# Ocean Acidification

Ocean Acidification (OA) experiment to demonstrate how atmospheric CO2 affects the pH of the ocean
- can be paired with [coral reef activity](https://github.com/GWLab-UML/Outreach/Activities/Coral-Reef-Activity.md)

- **Target Age Group:**

## Materials
- Waste container (with lid)
- 10 x Eye dropper
- 1 x Straws (at least 30, one for each kid)
- Glass test tubes (at least 24 for 4 sets, multiples of 6)
- Label ahead of time with what goes into it (lemon juice, vinegar, tap water, salt water, baking soda in water, soapy water)
- Red cabbage indicator liquid (just soak in boiling water for like 15 mins)
- Testing liquid
	- lemon juice
	- Vinegar
	- tap water
	- salt water (salt with extra stock shelf)
	- baking soda in water
	- soapy water
- Tube racks
- Small paper cups for blowing CO2 into their ‘own ocean’
- pH Paper
- Worksheet [link](https://github.com/GWLab-UML/Outreach/Activities/coral_OA_activity.pdf) (enough for each kid, ~30 printed double sided (can be black and white if concerned about ink usage))
- Notebooks

## Activity 
1. Split into groups - each group gets a tube rack with "mystery" liquids and pH indicator
2. Tube by tube, students write down their predictions if the "mystery" liquid is going to be acidic, basic or neutral
	- encourage discussions about reasons behind their predictions
3. Add pH indicator liquid - student write down what happens
	- discuss what happened and what it means
4. Students can "DIY" their own ocean water
	1. fill cup with tap water and add a few drops of the pH indicator 
	2. students blow bubbles in the water and watch as the CO2 from their breathe makes the water more acidic
	3. discuss what happened and how it relates to ocean acidification
