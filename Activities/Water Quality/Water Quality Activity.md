# Water Quality
- Using local water sources to show how water quality varies and how to measure water quality
- **Target Age Group:** K-12

## Materials
- Orion
- Refractometer
- Water to test
	- freshwater from local river/stream
	- oyster tank/saltwater
	- snow bank/puddle
	- tap water
- Lab notebooks

## Activity 
1. Give students the list of water sources, but anonymize the water sample so they don't know which one is which
2. Make hypotheses about what water samples will have worse water quality 
3. Measure water quality parameters (using Orion and refractometer) of different water samples 
4. Have students predict which water sample is which
5. Discuss what causes poor water quality in these samples and why they might be different
