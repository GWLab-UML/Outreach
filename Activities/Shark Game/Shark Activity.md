### Game 1: Tooth or Truth
1. Split into two groups - one GW person per group to act as team leaders, one person to emcee 
2. Each group gets a true and false card with printed out shark “facts”
3. The emcee reads each “fact” and the group discusses if they think it’s true or false, and hold up the card they picked 

### Game 2: Matching sharks and jaws/teeth
1. Still within two groups, lay out pictures of sharks on the table. The kids have to match the shark name to the picture of the shark
2. Bonus round: can they match 4 pictures of teeth to the right shark?

### Shark craft (after games)
1. Instruct to fold a fortune teller
2. Color to look like a shark 
	- Inside is red with teeth on border; outside is blue with gills, fins, eyes
3. Inside has ‘fortunes’ about their interaction with a shark
	- Ex: you lost a finger! You’re shark bait! You got lucky!
