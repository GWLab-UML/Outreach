# New England Crabs

## Materials:
- European Green crabs 
- Gloves 
- Cleaning supplies (spray, towels)
- White bins
- Styrofoam cooler boxes
- 4L jug of saltwater
- Cut up oyster bits
- Long tweezers
- Green crab coloring [prints](https://github.com/GWLab-UML/Outreach/Activities/CrabColorPrint.docx)
- Colored penciles/markers/crayons if needed

## Activity:
1. Each group gets a crab in a clear container
    - 3 groups, ~10 kids per group & 1 lab person per group
2. Introduce the species 
    - Very common in MA, invasive species, body can grow up to 4” not including legs
3. Lab person takes out crab and lets them see it closer, touch it
    - Remind kids that crabs pinch! Can go one-by-one so they all can touch it safely if they want to
4. Lab person sex crab
    - While holding it, flip it over to show the tummy then if you see a big triangle it’s a female and if you see more of a column shape it’s a male - eggs will be orange and spilling out from the female’s big triangle
5. Put crabs in big open top bin on the table so kids can see how they move
    - Warn them not to touch! (since we will stay with our group the whole time, we can keep an eye on them)
6. Give them the paper with the crab to color in and/or a plate to draw the crab themselves!
7. Side activity if any of the kids look bored - draw what crabs eat! 
    ○	Snails, worms, algae, eelgrass/seaweed

### Reflections:
Tristin
- Much smaller group of kids, they actually chose whether they wanted to come
- Made three main tables out of tables, only used 2
- Made groups of two, tables were rolling out from some kids
  More kids showed up when the teacher went to “get more victims” and told more kids about the crabs
- Kids actually ended up loving the snails; kids were told that they could hum to get the snails to come out of their shells, so they hummed a lot, and seemed to calm themselves down too
- A group came in from a field trip in the last 20 mins and it gave us a second wind because it seemed like most kids had kind of gotten bored with the crabs at that point
- Printed out crabs to color in were not a hit, a couple of kids did some, but not that many


Jade
- Good to have 2-3 set separate tables set up in “stations” or “groups”
- Not all kids wanted to color :( but some were taking videos of the snails with their phones
- Crabs were cool but kids really liked that they could touch/hold the snails - the novelty of the crabs wore off surprisingly quickly
- Kids seemed to like the idea of feeding the crabs - maybe next time “starve” the crabs to make them more readily eat haha
- Would be cool if we could have multiple crab species to compare - could maybe get them to draw / take notes this way
- Would be cool if we could have really small crabs/hermit crabs since then the kids could hold them without fear of being pinched
