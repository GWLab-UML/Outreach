# Oyster Filtration Activity
- Understanding the role of oysters in filtration and water quality 
- can be paired with water quality activity
- **Target Age Group:** K-12

## Materials
- Oysters (DON’T FEED BEFORE)
- Water (a bunch of 1L saltwater bottles)
- Food dye
- Dirt 
- Algae
- Beakers for oyster experiments
- Filter materials
	- Paper
	- Net?
	- Coffee filter? 

## Activity
1. Students ‘pollute’ one of the water basins using dirt and dye
	- Don't tell the kids that they are “polluting” the water, see if they say that themselves, whether or not they come to the conclusion that they “polluted” the water, say at the end that this is a model of them polluting the water
2. Set up oyster experiment all together
	- Put oysters in clean and "polluted" water basins (can start a timer if you want)
3. Write down hypotheses
	- What will they filter faster? 
4. With the rest of the water, try to filter stuff out of water using the filter materials (coffee filter, paper, net, etc.)
5. Then check back in at oyster experiment and discuss
	- Which tank did the oysers filter faster? 
	- Were the oysters able to filter the polluted water in that amount of time? 

6. (Can also have them take water samples and continue with water quality activity)
