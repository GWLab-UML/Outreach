# BGCGL Algae Activity

## Materials:
### For microscope activity: light activity with algae 
●	4 x Different algae species (in capped bottles)
●	Petri dishes
●	Water of varying salinities (tap water, 15psu, 30psu)
●	Mini microscopes
●	Droppers 

### For photosynthesis activity:
●	Spinach leaves
●	Straws
●	Baking soda solution (0.1%) ~100 ml per cup 
●	Liquid dish soap
●	5 Cups
●	5x10mL Syringes
●	Phone light/flashlight
●	Timers
●	Photosynthesis activity spreadsheet
●	Photosynthetic Floatation sheet

## Activities:

### Microscope
●	Look at the different algae species under the scope - draw them!
○	Are they different? How are they different?
●	What happens when you put them in diff salinities
●	What happens when you put them in diff light esxposures

### Photosynthesis/CO2
(taken from [here](https://cropps.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Photosynthetic-Floatation_-_-Biology-Physics-Science-Activity-_-Exploratorium.pdf)! Thanks Nikea)
●	What do we know about how plants and algae grow?
○	How do they eat? What do they need to eat?
●	Hypothesize what will happen, set a timer
○	Write down hypothesis and observations
●	How long does it take for the first disk to float? How long does it take for half the disks to float? All the disks?


## Reflections

Tristin:
 Ended up doing the spinach CO2 thing
	- kids were paying attention in the first half, and liked the demonstration, but when they had to wait for the spinach leaves to come back up, half the kids got real antsy
	- was a group of kids that started acting out and was def giving Brooke a hard time
		- they started play-fighting in the corner?????
- demonstrations good, but the waiting nah
	- wanted to do more experiment stuff with them, but ended up not in the moment cuz they couldn't wait very well lol
- kids actually learned photosynthesis with taking the CO2 out, but not really with the spinach coming back up
	- a couple of kids actually did stick around, but it was only a handful
		- 1 syringe broke
		- 1 kid wanted to make human DNA chicken eggs lol
