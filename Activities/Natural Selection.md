# Natural Selection

- Simulate predators with different feeding mechanisms—survival of the fittest!
- **Target Age Group:** Teens

## Learning Objectives
- Teens will be able to describe which feeding mechanism are the most *adapted* to certain prey items
- Teens will be able to...

## Materials 
- Paper cups
- Pencils
- Small dust pan
- Extra plastic bags 

*Prey items* (at least **three** of these of varying shapes/sizes)
- Kidney beans
- Lentils
- Fettuccine, snapped in thirds
	- This was a good inclusion; chip clips were more practical than utensils
- Quinoa
	- This was fun to get creative with the straws but a bit messy
- Mini marshmallows (*untested*)
- Ice cubes (*untested*)
- Feathers (*untested*)

*Predator feeding mechanisms* (at least **four** of these)
- Plastic spoon
- Plastic fork
- Bendy straw
- Toothpicks
- Chip clip
- Chopsticks (*untested*)
- Syringe (*untested*)
- Forceps (*untested*)
- Tape (*untested*)

## Activities 
1. The students will play predators! Have them choose which feeding mechanism they want to use to catch prey but don't yet show them what the prey item is. Ideally all types of feeding mechanisms are represented.
2. Dump out the first prey item (we started with kidney beans) in the middle of the circle of students or use trays for pairs of students to share.
3. Set the timer for 1 min (or 30 sec) and have the students catch as many prey as possible. They can only use their feeding mechanism tool and must lift the prey up off the table and move it to their stash (for example, no raking).
4. Count the number of prey caught (frequency) for each feeding mechanism and keep track with a table on the whiteboard. Calculate the median frequency.
5. Each predator feeding mechanism who manages to catch more than the median number of prey will survive and produce descendants with the same trait. Predators who perform worse than the median will not reproduce.
6. Repeat for 2-4 more generations.
7. Ask students to use the table's data to draw a graph of the frequencies for each predator feeding mechanism over the number of generations. What predator was the most successful and why? what predator was least successful and why?
8. Add in a different prey item and repeat the process. Will frequencies change for each predatory feeding mechanism with the new prey item? 

## Suggestions for next time
- Expand activity to include concepts like competition, resource availability, and niches
	- *Competition* - everyone takes food from the same pile
		- Can also get at *symbiosis* if teens end up helping each other
	- *Resource availability* - limit amount of food item(s)
	- *Niches* - multiple food types; do some predators only eat certain prey types?
- Have teens craft their own predator 
- Mimic predator feeding mechanisms on real animals
	- Fork = shark
	- Syringe = dolphin
	- Tape = octopus
	- Chip clip = crab
- Worksheet to facilitate 1) making hypotheses 2) writing down "data" 3) sketching graphs
	- Ideally this would all still be written on the whiteboard; the worksheets are for the teens to follow along and maybe have a little more stake in the game!
