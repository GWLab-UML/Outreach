# Natural Selection

- Simulate predators with different feeding mechanisms—survival of the fittest!
- **Target Age Group:** Teens

## Reference Links
- Adapted from: https://evoresconedu.gr/site/images/site/files/games/basic_concepts-en-game_3.pdf

## Learning Objectives
- Teens will be able to describe which feeding mechanism are the most *adapted* to certain prey items
- Teens will be able to...

## Materials 
- Paper cups
- Pencils
- Small dust pan
- Extra plastic bags 

*Prey items* (at least **three** of these of varying shapes/sizes)
- Kidney beans
- Lentils
- Fettuccine, snapped in thirds
	- This was a good inclusion; chip clips were more practical than utensils
- Quinoa
	- This was fun to get creative with the straws but a bit messy
- Mini marshmallows (*untested*)
- Ice cubes (*untested*)
- Feathers (*untested*)

*Predator feeding mechanisms* (at least **four** of these)
- Plastic spoon
- Plastic fork
- Bendy straw
- Toothpicks
- Chip clip
- Chopsticks (*untested*)
- Syringe (*untested*)
- Forceps (*untested*)
- Tape (*untested*)

## Activities 
1. [[ Detailed instructions of activity - remember that this is for the instructors! ]]

## Suggestions for next time
- Expand activity to include concepts like competition, resource availability, and niches
	- *Competition* - everyone takes food from the same pile
		- Can also get at *symbiosis* if teens end up helping each other
	- *Resource availability* - limit amount of food item(s)
	- *Niches* - multiple food types; do some predators only eat certain prey types?
- Have teens craft their own predator 
- Mimic predator feeding mechanisms on real animals
	- Fork = shark
	- Syringe = dolphin
	- Tape = octopus
	- Chip clip = crab
- Worksheet to facilitate 1) making hypotheses 2) writing down "data" 3) sketching graphs
	- Ideally this would all still be written on the whiteboard; the worksheets are for the teens to follow along and maybe have a little more stake in the game!
