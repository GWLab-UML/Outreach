- **Target Age Group:** 

## Materials
- Pipet and tips 
- Beaker for disposing pipet tips 
- Two hemocytometers
- Tape for labeling (red, green, and yellow)
- Sharpies 
- Two microscopes 
- Phone camera microscope 
- Gloves 
- Lab notebooks 
- Pencils 
- Kimwipes 
- Shucking knife
- Shucking glove
- Scalpel 
- Extension cord 
- Plastic bags for disposal 
- Ethanol 
- Two covered beakers of DI water (for cleaning the hemocytometer)
- Two covered beakers of soap water (for cleaning hemocytometer)
- Concentrated algae (x3 strains)
- Oysters 
- Six empty beakers (for algae)
- Three bottle containers (for bringing algae in)


## Activity 
1. Set up the beakers before the session starts 
	- Beaker set up:

| Strain 1              | Strain 2             | Strain 3              |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Tetraselmis No Oyster | Isochrysis No Oyster | Chaetoceros No Oyster |
| Tetraselmis Oyster    | Isochrysis Oyster    | Isochrysis Oyster     |

2. Before presentation, have the kids come watch the demonstration and quick algae explanation 
	- Oysters eat algae 
	- We have three different species of algae here and there are two beakers for each species 
		- Two tetraselmis, two isochrysis, two chaetoceros 
3. For the two beakers of each species, leave one beaker with no oysters and put oysters in the other one 
- Take a “before” photo to compare what the algae look like after some time 
	- Put a timer on phone?
	- One group will count the “before” algae 
	- One group will count the “after” algae 
- Dissect the oysters, open them up see what they look like if we can see the algae
