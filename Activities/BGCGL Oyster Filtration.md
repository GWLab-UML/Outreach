# Oyster Filtration Activity
Understanding the role of oysters in water quality 

## Materials
●	Oysters (DON’T FEED BEFORE)
●	Water (a bunch of 1L saltwater bottles)
●	Food dye
●	Dirt 
●	Algae
●	Beakers for oyster experiments
●	Filter materials
●	Paper
●	Net?
●	Coffee filter? 


## Activity
●	They’re going to ‘pollute’ water 
    ○	The water that the oysters are in and the one they will filter
●	Set up oyster experiment all together
●	Write down hypotheses
    ○	What will they filter faster? 
●	Rest of water - here’s foam/paper/nets - try to filter stuff out of water
●	Then check back in at oyster experiment and talk about it
