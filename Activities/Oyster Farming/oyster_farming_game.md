## Activities 
#### 1. Start with an introduction to aquaculture, farming, and vocabulary they might encounter.
>(these things do kinda get explained during the game, so don't need to overdue it and bore them)
- how do restaurants and markets get oysters? the majority of the oysters you eat are farmed
- hatcheries grow **oyster seed** which is basically baby oysters - farmers buy the seed or **spat** (oysters that are a little older, recently settled or attached to a hard surface)
    - small vs. large spat - what's the difference? why do they cost differently in the game? small is cheap, but large is hardier
- why do farmers flip cages? to reduce biofouling - what is biofouling?

#### 2. Get them started in the game
- make sure they don't spend too much time designing their character lol - keep them moving in the game!
- also encourage them to fill out the worksheet! It will make them stop and think about the choices they're making, instead of blowing through and clicking random things

#### 3. Group check-in at the end of year 1
- what worked? who made the most profit?
- what are you going to change going into year 2?

Throughout the game, walk around and check-in with students, ask/answer questions!
