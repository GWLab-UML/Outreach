# Shark Week
Shark Week Activity

## Materials:
●	Print out shark matching cards
●	Print out true/false sheet
●	Square paper 
●	Knowledge of how to fold a fortune teller lol
●	Fins (cut out from scrap)
●	Craft example
●	tape/staple/glue

## Activities

### Game 1: Tooth or Truth
●	Split into two groups - one GW person per group to act as team leaders, one person to emcee 
○	Each group gets a true and false card with printed out shark “facts”
●	The emcee reads each “fact” and the group discusses if they think it’s true or false, and hold up the card they picked 

### Game 2: Matching sharks and jaws/teeth
●	Document to print with shark pictures, name labels, and teeth!
●	Still within two groups, lay out pictures of sharks on the table. The kids have to match the shark name to the picture of the shark
●	Bonus round: can they match 4 pictures of teeth to the right shark?

### Shark craft (after games)
●	Instruct to fold a fortune teller
●	Color to look like a shark 
○	Inside is red with teeth on border; outside is blue with gills, fins, eyes
●	Inside has ‘fortunes’ about their interaction with a shark
○	Ex: you lost a finger! You’re shark bait! You got lucky!


## Reflections
Jade: 
●	True/False was fun but hard to keep everyone focused and come to a consensus - maybe consider giving everyone a true/false card and they can hold up what they think is right then we tally and say majority says… 
●	Matching game was fun and interactive, but it’s a bit hard if they don’t know ANYTHING about sharks since it’s just kinda random then…could include hints on the back of the photos?? Like this shark has a really big mouth (basking shark) or this shark has a black-tipped fin (reef shark)
●	One kid kept the basking shark printout because it was her favorite! Very cute - maybe can let everyone keep their favorite / glue the label and shark (and tooth) to a colored piece of paper?
●	Craft was very fun! Though some kids took it hard when their drawings didn’t turn out how they wanted to (one girl at my table was crying, but was able to distract her and focus on a different design + color with her) so important to remember to interact directly with the kids during this time
●	Also for the craft, I think everyone should try to fold them, but we should have some pre-folded to hand out after if they didn’t turn out right
●	I really liked how Morgan volunteered to write out the fortunes for the kids!
