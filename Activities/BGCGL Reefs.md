# Reefs
Understanding the role of reefs (oysters/coral) in protecting the shoreline from wave action 

## Materials:
●	Long, big bucket to put water in and simulate waves 
    ●   (or mutliple containers - each can house an individual reef)
●	Reef building supplies
    ●	Playdough
    ●	Rocks
    ●	Legos
    ●	Oyster shells
●	Water
●	Fake house (?)
●	‘Paddle’ or something to generate a wave

## Activity 
●	Talk briefly about the importance of reefs 
    ○	Ask leading questions about why a reef might be important when thinking about waves/coastline/storms
●	Split into groups/pairs/individuals if not a lot of people
●	Think and write down hypotheses about what would make a good reef - what would your perfect, ideal reef look like? 
●	Have them make a reef out of the materials we brought 
    ○	Goal is to see who’s reef is the best at protecting against waves
●	One by one, but their reef into the bin of water and generate waves
    ○	Or if using individual containers for each reef, pour water into each container 
●	Crown a winner with candy
●	Regroup and discuss
    ○	Were your hypotheses supported? Were those factors important for a good reef? 
    ○	What reef was the best? Why? What made it the best? 
    ○	If you did it again, what would you change? 
    ○	Why are oyster/coral reefs important?
