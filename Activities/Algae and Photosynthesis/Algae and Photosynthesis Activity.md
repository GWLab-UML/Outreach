# Algae and Photosynthesis Activity
- Intro algae: look at algae under the microscope and learn about the photosynthesis that they do 
- **Target Age Group:** can be K-12, but probably works best for older 12-16?

## Reference Links

## Materials:
### For microscope activity: light activity with algae 
- 4 x Different algae species (in capped bottles)
- Petri dishes
- Water of varying salinities (tap water, 15psu, 30psu)
- Mini microscopes
- Droppers 

### For photosynthesis activity:
- Spinach leaves
- Straws
- Baking soda solution (0.1%) ~100 ml per cup 
- Liquid dish soap
- 5 Cups
- 5x10mL Syringes
- Phone light/flashlight
- Timers
- Photosynthesis activity spreadsheet
- Photosynthetic Floatation sheet

## Activities:

### Microscope
1. Look at the different algae species under the scope - draw them!
	- Are they different? How are they different?
2. What happens when you put them in diff salinities?
3. What happens when you put them in diff light exposures?

### Photosynthesis/CO2
1. What do we know about how plants and algae grow?
	- How do they eat? What do they need to eat?
2. Hypothesize what will happen, set a timer
	- Write down hypothesis and observations
3. How long does it take for the first disk to float? How long does it take for half the disks to float? All the disks?
