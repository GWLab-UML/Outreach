# Water Quality
Using local water sources to show how water quality varies 

## Materials
●	Orion
●	refractometer
●	Water from merrimack
●	Water from stream
●	Lab notebooks

## Activity 
●	Make hypotheses about what water samples will have worse water quality 
●	Measure water quality parameters (using Orion and refractometer) of different water samples 
●	Discuss what causes poor water quality in these samples and why they might be different
