# Density 

## Materials
●	Different waters (can prep ahead of time or make there)
    ●	Sugar water 
    ●	Fresh water (tap)
    ●	Salt water 
●	Food coloring (if you want to color each of the waters for funsies)
●	3 containers for holding water solutions (want them to be pretty shallow and clear if possible)
●	Items to test density
    ●	Carrots 
●	Sugar 
●	Instant ocean 
●	Materials for building boats (items with varying weights/densities)
    ●	Honestly whatever you can find - empty pipette boxes, pieces of styrofoam, plastic wrap, aluminum foil, falcon tubes
●	Tape
●	Figurines (boat captains)
●	Aquarium rocks (weights) 

## Activity
●	Introduce idea of density 
●	Make different water solutions
●	Have kids guess which items will float or sink in the 3 waters 
●	Test different items' densities in different solutions - place carrot in all 3 
    ●	do the items sink or float in salt/tap/or sugar water? why?
●	Now that they have an idea about how density works, split into groups and they will build a boat 
●	Each group picks 5 items to build their boat with (unlimited tape/plastic wrap) and 1 boat captain 
●	Come together and test each groups' boat in all 3 waters 
    ●	why do some boats sink and others float? why do some boats float in salt water but not fresh?
●	For the boats that float, add weight (aquarium rocks) to see how good their boats are!
