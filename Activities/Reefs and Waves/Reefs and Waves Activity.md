# Reefs and Waves Activity
Understanding the role of reefs (oysters/coral) in protecting the shoreline from wave action 
- **Target Age Group:**
## Materials:
- Long, big bucket to put water in and simulate waves 
	- (or mutliple containers - each can house an individual reef)
- Reef building supplies
	- Playdough
	- Rocks
	- Legos
	- Oyster shells
- Water
- Fake house (?)
- ‘Paddle’ or something to generate a wave

## Activity 
1. Talk briefly about the importance of reefs 
	- Ask leading questions about why a reef might be important when thinking about waves/coastline/storms
2. Split into groups/pairs/individuals if not a lot of people
3. Think and write down hypotheses about what would make a good reef - what would your perfect, ideal reef look like? 
4. Have them make a reef out of the materials we brought 
	- Goal is to see who’s reef is the best at protecting against waves
5. One by one, but their reef into the bin of water and generate waves
	- Or if using individual containers for each reef, pour water into each container 
6. Crown a winner with candy
7. Regroup and discuss
	- Were your hypotheses supported? Were those factors important for a good reef? 
	- What reef was the best? Why? What made it the best? 
	- If you did it again, what would you change? 
	- Why are oyster/coral reefs important?
