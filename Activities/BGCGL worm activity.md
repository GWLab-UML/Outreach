# Worm activity

## Materials:
●	Worms (clam worms?)
●	Salt water of different salinities
●	Notebooks
●	Tupperware
●	Live oysters (juveniles and adults, keep on ice to transport - but back in tanks after if they’re still alive)
●	Dead oyster shells (there’s some in the -20 freezer, if in unlabeled bag, they’re fine to use)
●	Phone microscopes (and phones to use the scopes)
●	Worksheets for experiment hypothesis/observations?

## Activities:

### Behavior experiment I
1.	Prepare 2-3 tupperwares/containers of varying salinities (tap/DI water, ~15psu, ~30psu?) 
    a.	Talk about salinity - what is the salinity of the ocean? Of your drinking water? Etc.
    b.	Can bring the spectrophotometer to measure salinity? Or they can just take ur word for it lol, depends on if you think you’ll have extra time
2.	Introduce the worms
    a.	Where they came from, what they do
3.	Hypothesize what the worms will do in the different salinities
4.	Place a worm in one salinity at a time - observe, talk about behavior
5.	Keep going with the remaining salinities - talk about changes in behavior

### Behavior experiment II
1.	Place a worm in the tupperware with water
2.	Bring out a live oyster and oyster shells
3.	Hypothesize which option the worm will prefer and move towards
4.	Observe, talk about behavior
5.	Can repeat this but have two tupperwares, one oyster in one and the shells of a dead oyster in the other - record the amount of time it takes for the worm to touch the oyster
    a.	Can also repeat with replacing the dead oyster with the juvenile oyster - does the worm have a preference of old vs. young? Small vs. big?	

### Microscope & Craft
Look at the worm under the microscope - draw it! (can use the phone microscopes, we’ll have the big scope for fieldwork - two apps will need to be downloaded to use some of the scopes)
