# Shell Taxonomy

- Organize the tree of life with shells!
- **Target Age Group:** Teens

## Learning Objectives
- Teens will be able to draw and describe how phylogenetic trees are made
- Teens will be able to explain how phylogenetic trees inform us about the evolutionary history of organisms

## Materials 
- yarn/rope
- paper and writing utensils
- shells with a lot of variation

## Activities 
1. Start with a brief introduction about evolution and phylogenetics:
    - what's evolution? how do organisms evolve? 
    - what are trees? 
    - how do we use them?
    - why are they important or helpful?
2. Each student will be given a shell pile of various shapes, colors, textures and yarn/rope.
3. Give the students time to construct their own phylogenetic tree with the shells in front of them. Walk around and ask the students questions about their trees.
4. Pause and regroup - instruct students to take a look at their neighbors' trees - are they all the same? Are they different? 
5. Talk through the different ways you can construct trees - maybe someone focused on texture vs. color vs. shape!
6. If time remains, repeat with pictures of different organisms.
