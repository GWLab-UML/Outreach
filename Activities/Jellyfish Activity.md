# Jellyfish Experiment 

## Materials:
- Notebooks
- Magnifying glass
- Food dye
- Plastic bags 
- Mason Jars 
- Flask to observe jellyfish
- Beaker to transport jellyfish
- Mini Microscopes
- Petri dishes
- Colored paper
- Brine shrimp
- Jellyfish
- Scissors
- Thread/string
- Glitter
- Salt water to hold/transport jellyfish
- Pens/pencils

## Activity:
3 Stations (~15 minutes at each station)
### Craft Station
1. [Make jellyfish](https://www.pbs.org/parents/crafts-and-experiments/make-an-upcycled-jellyfish) out of plastic bags and mason jars
2. Talk about animals that might eat jellyfish (sea turtles) and how they mistake plastic bags for jellyfish
3. Encourage recycling plastic bags at grocery store

### Experiment Station
1. What is an experiment? A hypothesis?
2. Kids describe how the jellyfish move on their own with no changes
	- Side to side?
	- Up and down?
3. Record observations under different conditions
	- Changes to light (dark vs bright)
	- Changes to color paper under jellyfish
	- Changes to sound
	- Changes to movement (kids tap once or twice on side of petri dish)
4. Feed jellyfish (brine shrimp)

### Microscope Station
Kids take turns using microscope and drawing jellyfish 

## Reflections:
Tristin
- A little overwhelming, kids loved the craft through
- Didn’t have enough mason jars so ended up having to snatch some plastic water bottles from the table, and some of the kids were a little upset about that at first
- Do not give kids glitter and food dye and not expect them to go crazy
- Kids liked that they could bring the craft home
- 3 groups worked out well, but again, because the kids wanted to do the craft stuff (and it took longer than we thought it would) craft table got a bit much
- Marina (idk how spell her name) was out sick, so initially when me and Morgan showed up, we had to wait a couple of minutes for someone to figure out what to do with us/who could watch over us
- Met another student from UML (mechie) so that was cool!

Morgan
- My station was fun and informative, the attention was held well with the kids and i was able to talk through what i had planned and answer questions. 
- I did see tristin having problems at his station and we pivided plans and sarah helped with the kids. 
- I did find it hard at my station to explain a more complex animal than what they are used too. 
- Overall it was alot of fun and having the kids at stations was better to control and keep their attentions.
