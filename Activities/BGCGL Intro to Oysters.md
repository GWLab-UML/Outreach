# Intro to oysters!

## Materials
●	Adult oysters (~10, can bring some babies too)
●	Shucking knives
●	Shucking gloves
●	Lab gloves (smalls and mediums)
●	Cafeteria trays
●	Weigh boats
●	Paper towels (for cleanup)
●	Forceps (2-3 - not the good ones)
●	Scalpels (2-3 - don’t let the kids use these)
●	Mini scopes (in microscopes drawer - will need to download apps on phones to use)
●	Notebooks and pencils (~10)
●	Rulers 
●	Candy :)

## Activity
1.	Introduce the lab and present volunteers
2.	Ask them about oysters
    a.	Do you eat them? Have you seen one before? 
    b.	Where do they live? What do you think they do? What do they eat? 
3.	BEFORE shucking - look at the outside, what do you see? Draw it! 
    a.	Who has the biggest? Smallest? Thickest?
    b.	What do you think the inside will look like? 
4.	Shuck! (only volunteers)
    a.	What do you see? Draw it!
    b.	Is it what you expected?
    c.	What does it smell like? 
    d.	What are the different parts (anatomy)? What do you think each part does? Draw and label!
5.	Get scopes out
    a.	What changed when looking at them close up? Do you see more? Do tissues look differently from one another close up?

## Reflections
Julia
●	Chaotic in a good way, lots of kids - can’t hold their attention for long as a big group so probably would be better to split into smaller groups
●	I underestimated the number of kids so could’ve brought more supplies
●	Also didn’t anticipate that they would immediately destroy the inside of the oyster 
●	Slowing down and spending time with the oyster before opening it was good - forced them to look at it and how it was different from the person next to them (but kids are bad at sharing so one oyster per group wasn’t the best/could’ve reduced group sizes)
●	They have colored pencils/markers there! 

Tristin
●	Very loud, but not too bad (~30 kids in one space will do that)
●	Kids didn’t know that they were going to do oyster stuff beforehand, lunch right after, so that could have caused some unrest
●	Kids having side conversations, which isn’t bad, but there were a few small incidents 
●	Kids kind of bored after a few minutes of just drawing the oysters
●	Small hiccup at beginning with gloves (passes out xs when some kids needed s, so had to get those xs gloves off kids and throw more gloves away), should make sure to bring xs, s, and maybe m glove sizes
●	Lots of questions from kids at the same time
●	Kids immediately destroying oysters when opened, I think it might be good to have all kids huddle around someone from the lab dissecting the oyster like a classroom lesson the next time we want them to actually look at something and not destory it
●	Forgot to pass out stickers and candy (not sure if we can passout candy tho, also only had candy with peanuts in it, and lunch time next block)
