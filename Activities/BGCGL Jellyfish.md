## Activity:
3 Stations (~15 minutes at each station)
Grab jellyfish at 9am

### Craft (Tristin)
○	[Make jellyfish](https://www.pbs.org/parents/crafts-and-experiments/make-an-upcycled-jellyfish) out of plastic bags and mason jars
○	Talk about animals that might eat jellyfish (sea turtles) and how they mistake plastic bags for jellyfish
○	Encourage recycling plastic bags at grocery store

### Experiment (Sarah)
○	What is an experiment? A hypothesis?
○	Kids describe how the jellyfish move on their own with no changes
    ■	Side to side?
    ■	Up and down?
○	Changes to light (dark vs bright)
○	Changes to color paper under jellyfish
○	Changes to sound
○	Changes to movement (kids tap once or twice on side of petri dish)
○	Feed jellyfish (brine shrimp)

### Microscope and draw (Morgan)
○	Kids take turns using microscope and drawing jellyfish 

## Reflections:
Tristin
●	A little overwhelming, kids loved the craft through
●	Didn’t have enough mason jars so ended up having to snatch some plastic water bottles from the table, and some of the kids were a little upset about that at first
●	Do not give kids glitter and food dye and not expect them to go crazy
●	Kids liked that they could bring the craft home
●	3 groups worked out well, but again, because the kids wanted to do the craft stuff (and it took longer than we thought it would) craft table got a bit much
●	Marina (idk how spell her name) was out sick, so initially when me and Morgan showed up, we had to wait a couple of minutes for someone to figure out what to do with us/who could watch over us
●	Met another student from UML (mechie) so that was cool!

Morgan
●	My station was fun and informative, the attention was held well with the kids and i was able to talk through what i had planned and answer questions. 
●	I did see tristin having problems at his station and we pivided plans and sarah helped with the kids. 
●	I did find it hard at my station to explain a more complex animal than what they are used too. 
●	Overall it was alot of fun and having the kids at stations was better to control and keep their attentions.
