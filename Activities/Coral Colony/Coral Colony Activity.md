## Activity 
1.	Each kid gets a little bit of white clay and a plate - this is a ‘coral polyp’ and reef!
    a.	We introduce/talk about corals - coral skeleton and tissue don’t have color
    b.	Show pictures of colorless/algae-less coral
2.	Then we give them each a little bit of colored clay - this is the ‘symbiont’ 
    a.	We introduce/talk about algae/symbionts 
    b.	Show pictures of corals close up with algae
3.	Mix the white and colored clay - the algae gives coral its color!
    a.	Could add sprinkles to represent bacteria/other algae??
4.	Then give them time to make a coral reef with they clay and extra shells 
    a.	Talk about what reefs do
