## Materials:
Coral craft materials
- 2xWhite Air dry clay 
- 2xcolored air dry clay 
- Plates
- Oyster/mussel shells
- 4xCoral skeletons in lab FOR SHOW (do not let them put clay on it)
- Print out pictures of corals/polyps/symbionts
- Coral polyps without algae - link
- Coral images laminated in lab already
- Markers
- Stickers
## Activity 
1.	Each kid gets a little bit of white clay and a plate - this is a ‘coral polyp’ and reef!
    a.	We introduce/talk about corals - coral skeleton and tissue don’t have color
    b.	Show pictures of colorless/algae-less coral
2.	Then we give them each a little bit of colored clay - this is the ‘symbiont’ 
    a.	We introduce/talk about algae/symbionts 
    b.	Show pictures of corals close up with algae
3.	Mix the white and colored clay - the algae gives coral its color!
    a.	Could add sprinkles to represent bacteria/other algae??
4.	Then give them time to make a coral reef with they clay and extra shells 
    a.	Talk about what reefs do 

## Reflections:
(coral reef activity & OA experiment)

**JGM:**
- They really got into the pH and the Volunteer-lead gave them ‘science gear’ to wear so the kids loved it and felt like scientists
- Having smaller groups for this would be good - I was handling like 8-10 kids split into two groups at once and it was a little chaotic
- hard to hold all of their attention - maybe would’ve been good to give them the test tubes one at a time instead of having them all sit in the tube rack
- Also forgot to do the CO2 air blowing part
- Crayon brand clay did not mix well with 5 below clay and got super messy - but blue plates were a good idea

**Tristin:**
- The kids really liked both activities! Though there were a couple kids that didn’t want to wait and make hypothesies, and just wanted to do the experiment right away
	- Those same kids ended up being a bit of trouble makers when a couple more kids who they knew joined the classroom during the clay activity
	- They also really wanted to hog all the tubes, and do all the dye for each tube (maybe some more tubes next time?)
- We kinda forgot to do the CO2 ocean part lol, just because we were all so busy
- Kids liked that they could bring the clay stuff home
- Colored air dry clay was wayyyy too sticky, Jade warned me not to touch it thankfully
- White air dry clay actually takes a couple days to fully harden, so some kids where having trouble coloring their coral in
- I know I was having a hard time explaining the coral host/symbyant dynamic in a more dumbed down way, I knew too much lol
