# Water Density 

## Materials
- Different waters (can prep ahead of time or make there)
	- Sugar water 
	- Fresh water (tap)
	- Salt water 
- Food coloring (if you want to color each of the waters for funsies)
- 3 containers for holding water solutions (want them to be pretty shallow and clear if possible)
- Items to test density
	- Carrots 
- Sugar 
- Instant ocean 
- Materials for building boats (items with varying weights/densities)
	- Honestly whatever you can find - empty pipette boxes, pieces of styrofoam, plastic wrap, aluminum foil, falcon tubes
- Tape
- Figurines (boat captains)
- Aquarium rocks (weights) 

## Activity
1. Introduce idea of density 
2. Make different water solutions
3. Have kids guess which items will float or sink in the 3 waters 
4. Test different items' densities in different solutions - place carrot in all 3 
	- do the items sink or float in salt/tap/or sugar water? why?
5. Now that they have an idea about how density works, split into groups and they will build a boat 
	- Each group picks 5 items to build their boat with (unlimited tape/plastic wrap) and 1 boat captain 
6. Come together and test each groups' boat in all 3 waters 
	- why do some boats sink and others float? why do some boats float in salt water but not fresh?
7. For the boats that float, add weight (aquarium rocks) to see how good their boats are!
