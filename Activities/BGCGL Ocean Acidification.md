# Ocean Acidification
Ocean Acidification (OA) experiment to demonstrate how atmospheric CO2 affects the pH of the ocean

[Reference Link](https://www.calacademy.org/sites/default/files/assets/images/Education_Images/sah_ocean-acidification-experiment_201123.pdf) 

## Materials
●	Waste container (with lid)
●	10 x Eye dropper
●	1 x Straws (at least 30, one for each kid)
●	Glass test tubes (at least 24 for 4 sets, multiples of 6)
●	Label ahead of time with what goes into it (lemon juice, vinegar, tap water, salt water, baking soda in water, soapy water)
●	Extra tubes so each kid can blow air into their own “ocean”?
●	Red cabbage indicator liquid (just soak in boiling water for like 15 mins)
●	lemon juice
●	Vinegar (under front sink)
●	tap water
●	salt water (salt with extra stock shelf)
●	baking soda in water
●	soapy water
●	3 racks
●	Small paper cups for blowing CO2 into their ‘own ocean’
●	pH Paper
●	Worksheet [link](https://github.com/GWLab-UML/Outreach/Activities/coral_OA_activity.pdf) (enough for each kid, ~30 printed double sided (can be black and white if concerned about ink usage))
●	Notebooks

## Activity 

## Reflections:
(coral reef activity & OA experiment)

JGM:
●	They really got into the pH and the Volunteer-lead gave them ‘science gear’ to wear so the kids loved it and felt like scientists
○	Having smaller groups for this would be good - I was handling like 8-10 kids split into two groups at once and it was a little chaotic
○	hard to hold all of their attention - maybe would’ve been good to give them the test tubes one at a time instead of having them all sit in the tube rack
○	Also forgot to do the CO2 air blowing part
●	Crayon brand clay did not mix well with 5 below clay and got super messy - but blue plates were a good idea

Tristin:
●	The kids really liked both activities! Though there were a couple kids that didn’t want to wait and make hypothesies, and just wanted to do the experiment right away
○	Those same kids ended up being a bit of trouble makers when a couple more kids who they knew joined the classroom during the clay activity
○	They also really wanted to hog all the tubes, and do all the dye for each tube (maybe some more tubes next time?)
●	We kinda forgot to do the CO2 ocean part lol, just because we were all so busy
●	Kids liked that they could bring the clay stuff home
●	Colored air dry clay was wayyyy too sticky, Jade warned me not to touch it thankfully
●	White air dry clay actually takes a couple days to fully harden, so some kids where having trouble coloring their coral in
●	I know I was having a hard time explaining the coral host/symbyant dynamic in a more dumbed down way, I knew too much lol
